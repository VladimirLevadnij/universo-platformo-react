# Current Research Context

## üéØ ACTIVE: Flowise 2.2.8 Upgrade & Chatbot Refactoring Research

### APPs Architecture Implementation Research ‚úÖ

**Status**: COMPLETED - All research objectives achieved

#### APPs Architecture Pattern Analysis

-   ‚úÖ **4 Applications Successfully Implemented**: UPDL, Publish-FRT, Publish-SRV, Analytics-FRT
-   ‚úÖ **TypeScript + JSX Integration**: Solved with `allowJs: true` pattern in tsconfig.json
-   ‚úÖ **Modular Build System**: Consistent TypeScript + Gulp pipeline across all applications
-   ‚úÖ **Alias Integration**: Clean integration with main UI via `@apps/*` aliases

#### Results Achieved:

-   **UPDL Application**: Pure node definitions with Data nodes for quiz functionality
-   **Publish Frontend**: Complete AR.js builder with iframe rendering and multi-object support
-   **Publish Backend**: Integrated with main Flowise server, quiz results storage
-   **Analytics Frontend**: Single component architecture with JSX integration

### üîç NEXT: Flowise Upgrade & Chatbot Refactoring Research

#### Research Questions for Platform Upgrade:

1. **Breaking Changes**: What API changes exist between Flowise 2.2.7-patch.1 and 2.2.8?
2. **Dependency Updates**: Which packages need version updates and compatibility checks?
3. **Custom Integration Points**: How will UPDL nodes and APPs architecture be affected?
4. **Chatbot Extraction**: What components need to be moved to separate chatbot-frt application?

#### Research Areas:

-   **Flowise 2.2.8 Changelog**: Study official release notes and breaking changes
-   **Dependency Compatibility**: Research package version compatibility matrix
-   **Migration Strategy**: Plan step-by-step upgrade process with rollback options
-   **Chatbot Architecture**: Design chatbot-frt application following proven APPs pattern

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Research Focus

#### Platform Upgrade Considerations:

-   **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure all 4 existing applications continue working
-   **UPDL Node Compatibility**: Verify node definitions work with new Flowise version
-   **API Stability**: Check publication system API compatibility
-   **Build Process**: Ensure all TypeScript + Gulp pipelines remain functional

#### Chatbot Refactoring Strategy:

-   **Component Identification**: Map chatbot-specific components in main UI
-   **Dependency Analysis**: Identify chatbot dependencies and shared utilities
-   **Integration Points**: Design clean API between chatbot-frt and main application
-   **Migration Path**: Plan gradual migration without breaking existing functionality

### üìö Background Context

#### Current Technology Stack:

-   **Base**: Flowise 2.2.7-patch.1 (stable) ‚Üí **Target**: Flowise 2.2.8
-   **APPs Architecture**: 4 applications successfully implemented and working
-   **Custom Features**: Supabase auth, Uniks workspaces, i18n, UPDL nodes with quiz support
-   **AR Technology**: AR.js with A-Frame, iframe rendering, local library serving
-   **UI Framework**: React with Material-UI + modular APPs integration

#### Proven Patterns:
