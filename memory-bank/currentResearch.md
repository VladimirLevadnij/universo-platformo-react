# Current Research Context

**Purpose**: This file serves as a scratchpad for ongoing deep research findings from external analyses (other AI agents or sources). Use it to store detailed information or references that are currently being investigated, so as not to clutter the main context files. Keep it summarized and relevant. This file can be more free-form, but should still be in English and cleaned up when research is concluded (important findings can be moved into the relevant permanent files, and outdated info removed).

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Record ongoing research, external analysis, and temporary findings
- Use English language and structured notes (bullet points or short sections)
- Cite sources or link references when applicable
- Move relevant findings to permanent docs when research is concluded
- Remove outdated information to keep file current and relevant
