# Current Active Context

## Application Structure Refactoring - COMPLETED

### Goal ✅

Implement a unified, coherent structure for all applications in the apps/ directory, based on best practices and the architecture of the main Flowise project.

### Completed Steps

The following steps have been completed in the refactoring process:

1. Updated systemPatterns.md with the new architecture and made changes to tasks.md
2. Refactored publish-frt:
    - Created additional directories (assets, hooks, store, configs)
    - Renamed the miniapps directory to features
    - Created API client structure
    - Updated index.ts
    - Updated README.md
3. Refactored publish-srv:
    - Created directories for controllers, routes, interfaces, middlewares
    - Implemented new types and interfaces
    - Implemented REST endpoints and controllers
    - **Radically simplified codebase, removed all unnecessary components and files**
    - **Streamlined to minimal MVP for AR.js streaming generation only**
    - Updated server.ts and index.ts to integrate with main Flowise
    - Updated README.md
4. Completed asset management restructuring:
    - Created proper icons/ and images/ directories
    - Moved all static assets to appropriate locations
    - Updated import paths to reference new locations
5. Migrated miniapps to features:
    - Renamed directory structure for better clarity
    - Updated all import paths to use new structure
    - Removed old miniapps directories after confirming functionality
6. Improved AR.js publication interface:
    - Fixed initial state of "Сделать публичным" toggle to match Flowise patterns
    - Removed redundant "actions.close" button from interface
    - Removed duplicate "actions.copyLink" button to clean up UI
7. **✅ UPDL Applications Complete Refactoring (January 2025)**:
    - **Removed updl-srv entirely** - determined unnecessary as Flowise server handles all backend logic
    - **Renamed updl-frt to updl** - simplified naming
    - **Cleaned updl from all export/publication related code** - only UPDL node definitions remain
    - **Removed all legacy export functionality** - configs, store, api directories
    - **Streamlined to pure UPDL node definitions** - assets, hooks, i18n, interfaces, nodes, utils only
    - **Updated package.json and documentation** - reflects new simplified structure
    - **Verified build process works correctly** - all tests pass

### Current Architecture ✅

**Final simplified architecture achieved:**

```
apps/
├── updl/           # UPDL node definitions for Flowise (formerly updl-frt)
├── publish-frt/    # Publication frontend
└── publish-srv/    # Publication backend
```

### Key Decisions

-   **UPDL-SRV REMOVED**: Determined that Flowise server already provides all needed backend functionality
-   **UPDL-FRT → UPDL**: Simplified naming as there's no corresponding server application
-   **Pure node focus**: UPDL app now contains only node definitions, no export/publication logic
-   **Clean separation**: Publication handled entirely by publish-frt/publish-srv applications
-   **Flowise integration**: UPDL nodes loaded directly by Flowise NodesPool from apps/updl/base/dist/nodes
-   Each application contains its own interfaces and types
-   Clearly separated features by technology under the features/ directory
-   **Radically simplified all applications to include only essential functionality**

**Current Sprint**: 1.0.0 pre-alpha (January 2025)

**Status**: ✅ **REFACTORING COMPLETED**

## Current Focus ✅

### Final Applications Structure

Architecture has been finalized and implemented:

-   **updl**: Node definitions for UPDL system (Scene, Object, Camera, Light nodes)

    -   Pure node definitions and related utilities
    -   Assets (icons), hooks, i18n, interfaces, nodes, utils only
    -   No export/publication logic - focused on Flowise integration
    -   Loads into Flowise via NodesPool mechanism

-   **publish-frt**: Frontend for publication system (UI components, export options)

    -   Standard directory structure with features/, components/, api/ etc.
    -   Technology-specific modules in features/ directory
    -   Static assets properly organized in assets/icons/ and assets/images/
    -   HTTP clients in api/ for backend communication
    -   Clear interfaces and types in interfaces/

-   **publish-srv**: Backend for publication system (API endpoints, minimal UPDL to AR.js support)
    -   **Minimal structure with only controllers/, routes/, interfaces/, middlewares/**
    -   **Only three REST API endpoints for AR.js publication**
    -   **Focused specifically on UPDL streaming generation**
    -   **Tight integration with main Flowise server**
    -   **No standalone server capability - designed as an extension only**

This separation:

-   Provides clearest possible responsibility boundaries
-   Maximizes simplicity and maintainability
-   Enables clean integration with Flowise core
-   Eliminates code duplication
-   **Achieves optimal architecture for MVP functionality**

### Current Development Status ✅

**REFACTORING PHASE COMPLETED**

-   [x] Developed `AFrameModel` layer for A-Frame element representation
-   [x] Implemented `UPDLToAFrameConverter` for converting UPDL scenes to A-Frame
-   [x] Established base exporter architecture with clear responsibilities
-   [x] Created `ARJSExporter` for generating HTML from UPDL scenes
-   [x] Refactored code to clearly separate AR.js and A-Frame implementations
-   [x] Standardized directory structure across applications
-   [x] Completed migration from miniapps to features
-   [x] **Radically simplified publish-srv to minimal MVP for AR.js**
-   [x] **Removed all unused code, services, and controllers from publish-srv**
-   [x] **✅ COMPLETED refactoring of UPDL applications**
-   [x] **✅ REMOVED updl-srv as unnecessary**
-   [x] **✅ CLEANED updl from all export/publication logic**
-   [x] **✅ VERIFIED system works correctly after refactoring**

## Implementation Strategy ✅

**ACHIEVED**: Simplified architecture with clear separation of concerns:

-   **UPDL nodes** → Define universal scene abstractions in Flowise
-   **Publish system** → Handle export to specific technologies (AR.js, etc.)
-   **Flowise core** → Provide backend processing via utilBuildUPDLflow

All applications now focus on their core purpose without unnecessary complexity.

## Current Status ✅

**REFACTORING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

The application architecture refactoring has been completed with all goals achieved:

1. ✅ Simplified UPDL to pure node definitions
2. ✅ Removed unnecessary updl-srv application
3. ✅ Cleaned all export/publication logic from UPDL
4. ✅ Verified build process works correctly
5. ✅ Updated all documentation

**Next phase**: Focus on enhancing publication functionality and user experience.
