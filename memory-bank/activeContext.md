# Current Active Context

**Status**: Alpha v0.29.0 (2025-09-17) - Quiz Lead Saving Reliability Patch Applied

## Current Project Focus

**Quiz Lead Saving Reliability Patch (2025-09-17)** - ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Quiz Debug Logging System Enhancement (2025-09-17)** - ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Analytics Page Refactor (2025-09-17)** - ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Implemented Changes:**
- Replaced single Chatflow selector with hierarchical Space -> Canvas selectors (auto-select first Space and first Canvas by backend order)
- Added consolidated `spacesApi` (frontend) using centralized `@universo/spaces-frt` package with `getSpaces` and `getCanvases` hitting existing server routes `/unik/:id/spaces` and `/unik/:id/spaces/:spaceId/canvases`
- Updated Analytics UI to request leads by selected Canvas (still using existing leads endpoint with `chatflowid` mapped to Canvas ID)
- Introduced dedicated phone column and refactored points column to use `lead.points` with legacy fallback to numeric `phone`
- Updated i18n (EN/RU) with new keys: `selectSpace`, `selectCanvas`, `table.phone`, and renamed Chatflow ID label to Canvas ID / ID холста
- Updated documentation (publish-frt README EN/RU) removing obsolete note about temporary storage of points in `lead.phone` and referencing new `lead.points`
- **API Architecture Consolidation**: Removed duplicate `packages/ui/src/api/spaces.js` file and ensured all spaces functionality uses centralized `apps/spaces-frt/base/src/api/spaces.js` with proper exports
- Fixed runtime error "F.map is not a function" by adding defensive parsing for API response format `{success, data: {spaces}}` vs expected array

**Completed Tasks:**
- ✅ Error diagnosis and fix for white page crash
- ✅ API consolidation using centralized spaces-frt package 
- ✅ Defensive response parsing for wrapped API responses
- ✅ Package cleanup and proper import architecture
- ✅ Successful builds of all affected packages

**Rationale:** Align analytics with Space+Canvas domain model, improve disambiguation where multiple canvases share names across Spaces, maintain clean package separation per refactoring strategy, and finalize transition to dedicated `points` column.


**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Introduced dual-layer debug control: build-time `QUIZ_DEBUG` constant and mutable runtime `QUIZ_DEBUG_STATE`
- ✅ Added `dbg()` utility wrapper gating all non-error logs
- ✅ Added public runtime API `window.setQuizDebug(true|false)` for live toggling without rebuild
- ✅ Converted all previous “key” production logs (init, results, lead save attempt/success, scene transitions) to conditional debug logs
- ✅ Retained `console.error` for genuine error conditions only
- ✅ Updated English README with "Debug Logging" section
- ✅ Added Russian localized `README-RU.md` with synchronized guidance
- ✅ Verified CJS/ESM/types builds produce no stray logs when debug disabled

**Architecture Decision:** Replace noisy unconditional logging with an opt-in layered system enabling deep diagnostics on demand while keeping production console output clean (errors only). Runtime toggle chosen to avoid rebuild cycles during troubleshooting sessions.

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Root cause analysis: initial regression where no lead saved if no form; subsequent duplication risk via dual showQuizResults paths
- ✅ Guarded saving moved into `showQuizResults` (primary for results-ending quizzes)
- ✅ Immediate save retained only for non-results endings (basic record fallback)
- ✅ Added origin-tagged logging (`results-completion-path`, `results-navigation-path`, `no-results-ending`, `unknown`)
- ✅ Extended payload logging (pre-payload, payload, warnings if IDs null)
- ✅ Removed second navigation-path invocation of `showQuizResults` to prevent double call race
- ✅ Global `leadSaved` flag still enforced for deduplication
- ✅ Rebuilt `@universo/template-quiz` (CJS/ESM/types) with successful TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Added quiet logging mode (QUIZ_DEBUG=false) + dbg() wrapper, removed verbose scene/object enumeration & point spam

**Technical Implementation:**
- Guarded save executed inside `showQuizResults(totalPoints, fromCompletionFlag)`; basic record synthesized when no form submitted
- Non-results completions perform immediate guarded save (maintains previous analytics behavior)
- Origin parameter threaded through `saveLeadDataToSupabase(…, origin)` for observability
- Removed redundant post-navigation `showQuizResults` trigger; only `showCurrentScene` handles results scene display
- Detailed console tracing enables verification of single POST request

**Architecture Decision:**
Shift from single centralized completion save to context-aware saving (results vs non-results) to resolve timing issues rendering results scene while still guaranteeing exactly one persisted lead (with points). Enhanced observability chosen over silent logic to accelerate future diagnostics.

**Previous Completed:**

**AR.js Legacy Configuration Management Implementation (2025-09-17)** - ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Advanced legacy configuration detection and handling system
- ✅ Environment-controlled auto-correction vs recommendation behavior (`PUBLISH_AUTO_CORRECT_LEGACY_SETTINGS`)
- ✅ Three-tier handling: new spaces, legacy with auto-correction, legacy with recommendations
- ✅ Alert UI system with dismissible info/warning messages for legacy scenarios
- ✅ Comprehensive translation keys for different legacy handling messages
- ✅ Fixed English locale issue ("coming soon" translation key)
- ✅ Backend API integration with `autoCorrectLegacySettings` flag exposure

**Technical Implementation:**
- Environment variable with comprehensive documentation in `.env.example`
- Legacy detection logic in `ARJSPublisher.jsx` loadSavedSettings function
- Alert state management and UI component integration
- Translation keys added to both Russian and English locales
- Build validation successful for both frontend and backend

**Architecture Decision:**
Implemented sophisticated three-scenario handling:
1. **New spaces**: Apply global settings directly
2. **Legacy with auto-correction**: Automatically update settings, show info alert
3. **Legacy with recommendations**: Preserve settings, show warning alert

**Previous Completed:**

**AR.js Global Library Management Alert Internationalization (2025-01-16)** - ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Implemented Features:**

- ✅ Parameter name mismatch resolved (id vs unikId in nested routes)
- ✅ Router mounting order fixed to prevent route conflicts
- ✅ Nested routing bugs eliminated with middleware transformations

**Technical Implementation:**
- Three-tier routing architecture: collections (/uniks), individual (/unik/:id), nested (/unik/:id/resources)
- Parameter transformation middleware for backward compatibility
- Route precedence optimization to avoid conflicts
- Complete build validation with no errors
