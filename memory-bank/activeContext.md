# Current Active Context

## CURRENT PROJECT FOCUS: Platform Enhancement & Evolution (v0.17.0+)

### üéØ Next Priorities (0.18.0-0.20.0)

**Focus**: Advanced development and system maturation

1. **Platform Stabilization (0.18.0)** - Enhanced user profiles, architecture consolidation, stability improvements
2. **Advanced UPDL Development (0.19.0)** - New node types, Universo MMOOMM integration with PlayCanvas
3. **Publication System Evolution (0.20.0)** - Project versioning, **transition to Alpha status**

### ‚úÖ Recent Key Achievements

**Platform Foundation Complete:**

-   ‚úÖ **Flowise 2.2.8 Platform Upgrade** - Enhanced ASSISTANT support, preserved user isolation
-   ‚úÖ **Profile-SRV Workspace Package** - Converted to `@universo/profile-srv` with clean imports
-   ‚úÖ **Enhanced User Profiles** - Secure email/password updates, nickname system
-   ‚úÖ **Menu Improvements** - Updated navigation and external documentation links

### üèóÔ∏è APPs Architecture Overview

**6 Working Applications:**

-   **UPDL** (`apps/updl/`) - Pure node definitions for Flowise editor
-   **Publish Frontend/Backend** (`apps/publish-frt/`, `apps/publish-srv/`) - AR.js publication system
-   **Analytics** (`apps/analytics-frt/`) - Quiz analytics and reporting
-   **Profile Frontend** (`apps/profile-frt/`) - User profile management with i18n
-   **Profile Backend** (`@universo/profile-srv`) - Workspace package backend service

**Core Technologies:**

-   React + Material-UI frontend with APPs architecture
-   Node.js + TypeScript backend with Supabase integration
-   Enhanced authentication with secure profile management
-   UPDL system for AR.js export with quiz functionality
