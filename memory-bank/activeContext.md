# Current Active Context

## Current Project Status

**Status**: **Alpha Achieved (v0.21.0-alpha, July 2025)** - Production-ready platform with complete UPDL system

**Platform Maturity**: Alpha-grade stability with 6 working applications and complete high-level UPDL node system

## Current Focus

**Post-Alpha Development** - Expanding advanced UPDL features and Universo MMOOMM capabilities:

-   **Advanced UPDL Node Types**: Physics, Animation, Networking nodes for complex interactions
-   **Universo MMOOMM Expansion**: Full MMO development pipeline with PlayCanvas
-   **Production Deployment**: Enterprise-grade hosting and scaling solutions
-   **Community Features**: Template sharing and collaborative development tools

## Recently Completed

**MMOOMM Entity Hardcode Elimination Fix**: Successfully completed on 2025-08-06. Eliminated all hardcoded transform values in MMOOMM Entity types that were overriding UPDL settings from Chatflow. Fixed JavaScript variable scope conflicts and preserved all game functionality.

**Previous Development**: Enhanced Resource System with Material Density implemented successfully. Created realistic material physics with separate weight/volume tracking, 16 material types with proper densities (0.001-21.5 t/m³), enhanced inventory system supporting both tons and m³, and improved mineable components with hardness/volume properties. MMOOMM ship.ts refactoring also completed with 90.6% code reduction and modular shared templates architecture.

## System Architecture

**6 Working Applications** (see [productContext.md](productContext.md) for details):

-   **UPDL**: High-level abstract nodes (Space, Entity, Component, Event, Action, Data, Universo)
-   **Publish Frontend/Backend**: Multi-technology export (AR.js, PlayCanvas)
-   **Analytics**: Quiz performance tracking
-   **Profile Frontend/Backend**: Enhanced user management with workspace packages

**Core Technologies**: React + Material-UI, Node.js + TypeScript, Supabase integration, PNPM workspaces

## Technical Status

**Base Platform**: Flowise 2.2.8 with enhanced ASSISTANT support
**Build Quality**: 100% TypeScript compilation success across entire workspace
**Export Pipeline**: Template-based system for AR.js (production) and PlayCanvas (ready)
**Security**: Enhanced Supabase authentication with secure profile management

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priorities**:

-   Advanced UPDL node development (Physics, Animation, Networking)
-   Universo MMOOMM feature expansion
-   Production deployment preparation
-   Community collaboration features
