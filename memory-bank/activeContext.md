# Current Active Context

## Current Project Status

**Status**: **Alpha Achieved (v0.21.0-alpha, July 2025)** - Production-ready platform with complete UPDL system

**Platform Maturity**: Alpha-grade stability with 6 working applications and complete high-level UPDL node system

## Current Focus

**Post-Alpha Development** - Expanding advanced UPDL features and Universo MMOOMM capabilities:

-   **Advanced UPDL Node Types**: Physics, Animation, Networking nodes for complex interactions
-   **Universo MMOOMM Expansion**: Full MMO development pipeline with PlayCanvas
-   **Production Deployment**: Enterprise-grade hosting and scaling solutions
-   **Community Features**: Template sharing and collaborative development tools

## Recent Status

**Current Development**: Universo MMOOMM laser mining system completed with full functionality. Industrial laser mining with auto-targeting, 3-second mining cycles, and inventory integration now working without visual artifacts. System includes state machine (idle, targeting, mining, collecting) with instant laser beam hide/show for smooth gameplay experience.

## System Architecture

**6 Working Applications** (see [productContext.md](productContext.md) for details):

-   **UPDL**: High-level abstract nodes (Space, Entity, Component, Event, Action, Data, Universo)
-   **Publish Frontend/Backend**: Multi-technology export (AR.js, PlayCanvas)
-   **Analytics**: Quiz performance tracking
-   **Profile Frontend/Backend**: Enhanced user management with workspace packages

**Core Technologies**: React + Material-UI, Node.js + TypeScript, Supabase integration, PNPM workspaces

## Technical Status

**Base Platform**: Flowise 2.2.8 with enhanced ASSISTANT support
**Build Quality**: 100% TypeScript compilation success across entire workspace
**Export Pipeline**: Template-based system for AR.js (production) and PlayCanvas (ready)
**Security**: Enhanced Supabase authentication with secure profile management

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priorities**:

-   Advanced UPDL node development (Physics, Animation, Networking)
-   Universo MMOOMM feature expansion
-   Production deployment preparation
-   Community collaboration features
