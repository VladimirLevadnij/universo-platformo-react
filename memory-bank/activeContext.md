# Current Active Context

## Current Project Status

**Status**: **Alpha Achieved (v0.21.0-alpha, July 2025)** - Production-ready platform with complete UPDL system

**Platform Maturity**: Alpha-grade stability with 6 working applications and complete high-level UPDL node system

## Current Focus

**Post-Alpha Development** - Expanding advanced UPDL features and Universo MMOOMM capabilities:

-   **Advanced UPDL Node Types**: Physics, Animation, Networking nodes for complex interactions
-   **Universo MMOOMM Expansion**: Full MMO development pipeline with PlayCanvas
-   **Production Deployment**: Enterprise-grade hosting and scaling solutions
-   **Community Features**: Template sharing and collaborative development tools

## Recent Status (July 2025)

**Release 0.21.1-alpha "UPDL Priority Fix"** - Critical architecture fix completed:

-   Fixed Entity Type Logic vs Component Render execution order in MMOOMM template
-   UPDL Component Render settings now properly override hardcoded Entity Type defaults
-   Preserved all MMO game mechanics (physics, collision, mining, trading) while making visuals configurable
-   Simplified implementation without complex architecture changes

**Release 0.21.0-alpha "Firm Resolve"** - Major improvements completed:

-   Memory Bank system optimization with improved file structure and guidelines
-   MMOOMM template stabilization with enhanced ship controls and physics handling
-   Handler architecture refactoring for better code organization and maintainability
-   Documentation updates reflecting new handler folder structure

## System Architecture

**6 Working Applications** (see [productContext.md](productContext.md) for details):

-   **UPDL**: High-level abstract nodes (Space, Entity, Component, Event, Action, Data, Universo)
-   **Publish Frontend/Backend**: Multi-technology export (AR.js, PlayCanvas)
-   **Analytics**: Quiz performance tracking
-   **Profile Frontend/Backend**: Enhanced user management with workspace packages

**Core Technologies**: React + Material-UI, Node.js + TypeScript, Supabase integration, PNPM workspaces

## Technical Status

**Base Platform**: Flowise 2.2.8 with enhanced ASSISTANT support
**Build Quality**: 100% TypeScript compilation success across entire workspace
**Export Pipeline**: Template-based system for AR.js (production) and PlayCanvas (ready)
**Security**: Enhanced Supabase authentication with secure profile management

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priorities**:

-   Advanced UPDL node development (Physics, Animation, Networking)
-   Universo MMOOMM feature expansion
-   Production deployment preparation
-   Community collaboration features
