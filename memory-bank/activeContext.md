-   ‚úÖ **Universo MMOOMM Foundation** - PlayCanvasMMOOMMBuilder for MMO development pipeline
-   ‚úÖ **Template Architecture** - Flexible export system supporting multiple target technologies with template-first paradigm
-   ‚úÖ **PlayCanvas UI Bug Fix** - Fixed duplicate settings display in Configuration vs Publication tabs

### üîÑ **CURRENT STATUS: HIGH-LEVEL UPDL SYSTEM COMPLETE**

**Major Milestone Achieved (January 2025):**

-   ‚úÖ **High-Level UPDL Nodes**: All 7 core abstract nodes implemented (Space, Entity, Component, Event, Action, Data, Universo)
-   ‚úÖ **PlayCanvas Pipeline**: Complete export system with template-based architecture
-   ‚úÖ **Universo MMOOMM**: Foundation ready for MMO development with PlayCanvasMMOOMMBuilder
-   ‚úÖ **Template System**: Flexible export supporting multiple target technologies
-   ‚úÖ **UI Integration**: PlayCanvas settings properly integrated in publication workflow

**System Status:**

-   ‚úÖ **Build Quality**: All applications compile successfully with zero TypeScript errors
-   ‚úÖ **Export Pipeline**: Template-based export system operational for AR.js and PlayCanvas
-   ‚úÖ **Node Ecosystem**: Complete high-level abstraction layer implemented
-   ‚úÖ **Technology Support**: AR.js (production), PlayCanvas (ready), additional templates (extensible)

**Ready for**: Next phase development focusing on advanced features and production deployment

### üèóÔ∏è APPs Architecture Overview

**6 Working Applications:**

-   **UPDL** (`apps/updl/`) - Pure node definitions for Flowise editor
-   **Publish Frontend/Backend** (`apps/publish-frt/`, `apps/publish-srv/`) - AR.js publication system
-   **Analytics** (`apps/analytics-frt/`) - Quiz analytics and reporting
-   **Profile Frontend** (`apps/profile-frt/`) - User profile management with i18n
-   **Profile Backend** (`@universo/profile-srv`) - Workspace package backend service

**Core Technologies:**

-   React + Material-UI frontend with APPs architecture
-   Node.js + TypeScript backend with Supabase integration
-   Enhanced authentication with secure profile management
-   UPDL system for AR.js export with quiz functionality

_Detailed architecture available in [productContext.md](productContext.md)_

### üîÑ Current System Status

**Base Platform**: Flowise 2.2.8 with Universo-specific enhancements
**User Management**: Supabase auth + enhanced profiles with nickname system
**Publication**: Working AR.js quiz system with analytics
**Security**: Enhanced with current password verification and encrypted storage
**Build System**: PNPM workspaces with professional package structure

### üí° Strategic Direction

**Architecture Goals:**

-   Maintain modular APPs structure for scalability
-   Enhance UPDL capabilities for diverse project types
-   Introduce a high-level, abstract UPDL node system (`Entity`, `Component`, etc.).
-   Develop a flexible export template system to replace hardcoded logic.
-   Prepare for Universo MMOOMM integration via PlayCanvas
-   Build toward production-ready Alpha status in 0.20.0

**Development Approach:**

-   Incremental enhancement with backward compatibility
-   Focus on user experience and workflow optimization
-   Expand UPDL node ecosystem for complex project creation
-   Implement advanced project versioning and publication management

**CURRENT COMPLEXITY LEVEL**: Ready for Level 3-4 (Advanced Features)
**PLATFORM MATURITY**: Pre-Alpha ‚Üí Alpha transition planned (0.20.0)
