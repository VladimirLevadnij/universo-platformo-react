## Stage 2 Issues & Lessons Learned

The initial AR.js implementation faced several challenges:

1. **Complex architecture**: The hybrid approach with both client and server generation proved too complex for the initial MVP
2. **Unclear separation**: AR.js and A-Frame technologies were not clearly separated in the codebase
3. **Disconnected components**: UPDL nodes were not properly connected to the publication flow
4. **Build process issues**: Publication worked in development mode but failed in production builds
5. **Localization structure issues**: Improper organization of i18n keys caused display problems in UI components

These insights have informed our revised approach for Stage 3.

## In Progress

-   **Simplified architecture** ‚Äî Streamlining the apps/updl and apps/publish structure ‚úÖ
-   **Interface restructuring** ‚Äî Reorganized "Publish & Export" interface with better UX ‚úÖ
-   **Streaming AR.js generation** ‚Äî Implementing client-side UPDL to AR.js conversion üîÑ

## May 3, 2025 - AR.js Publication Interface Improvements

### Completed

1. **Fixed initial AR.js publication interface issues:**
    - Changed default state of "–°–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –ø—É–±–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–º" toggle to false
    - Removed redundant "actions.close" button from interface
    - Eliminated duplicate "actions.copyLink" button to clean up UI

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Supabase integration for AR.js publications:**

    - Use existing `chat_flow` table structure for AR.js publication data
    - Store settings in `chatbotConfig` field
    - Update isPublic flag in database when toggled

2. **Further improve UX for publication status:**
    - Load previously saved publication state when opening interface
    - Synchronize link display with toggle state
    - Add automatic state update on toggle

This work improves the publication interface to align with Flowise design patterns and fixes several redundant or confusing UI elements. The next phase will focus on properly integrating with the database for state persistence.
