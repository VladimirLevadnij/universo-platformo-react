## Stage 2 Issues & Lessons Learned

The initial AR.js implementation faced several challenges:

1. **Complex architecture**: The hybrid approach with both client and server generation proved too complex for the initial MVP
2. **Unclear separation**: AR.js and A-Frame technologies were not clearly separated in the codebase
3. **Disconnected components**: UPDL nodes were not properly connected to the publication flow
4. **Build process issues**: Publication worked in development mode but failed in production builds
5. **Localization structure issues**: Improper organization of i18n keys caused display problems in UI components
6. **Unnecessary complexity in UPDL**: Export/publication functionality duplicated logic found in Flowise core

These insights informed our revised approach for Stage 3, leading to the simplified architecture we now have.

## Recent Major Achievements

### ✅ UPDL Applications Complete Refactoring (Completed)

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**

-   **Removed updl-srv entirely** - Flowise server provides all needed backend functionality
-   **Renamed updl-frt to updl** - Simplified naming without corresponding server app
-   **Cleaned UPDL from export/publication logic** - Streamlined to pure node definitions only
-   **Verified system integrity** - All builds pass, UPDL nodes work correctly

**Final Architecture:**

```
apps/
├── updl/           # Pure UPDL node definitions
├── publish-frt/    # Publication frontend
└── publish-srv/    # Publication backend
```

### Application Structure Refactoring (Completed)

-   **Standardized directory structure** across all applications
-   **Features migration** from miniapps → features in publish-frt
-   **Asset management improvement** with dedicated directories
-   **REST API communication** between applications with type-safe clients
-   **Documentation updates** reflecting current architecture

## Current Status ✅

**Core Foundation Completed:**

-   ✅ APPs architecture with 4 working applications
-   ✅ UPDL node system integrated with Flowise
-   ✅ AR.js publication flow with quiz functionality
-   ✅ Supabase multi-user authentication
-   ✅ Profile system with workspace package architecture

**Architecture Principles:**

-   **UPDL** → Pure node definitions for Flowise integration
-   **Publish system** → Handle export to specific technologies
-   **Flowise core** → Provide backend processing via existing utilities

**Next Priorities:**

-   Enhanced user experience and interface improvements
-   Advanced UPDL node types for diverse project creation
-   Project versioning and publication system evolution

## UPDL Architecture Simplification ✅

**Key Changes:**

1. **Eliminated updl-srv** - Flowise server provides all backend functionality
2. **Simplified updl app** - Pure node definitions only, removed export/publication logic
3. **Verified system integrity** - All builds pass, no regressions

**Impact:** Clean separation of concerns, reduced code duplication, simplified maintenance.

# Progress Log

## Latest Achievements

### 2025-01-27: Template-First Architecture Refactoring ✅

**Publication system architecture modernized** - Successfully migrated from technology-first structure to template-first structure in `publish-frt` application. Changed from `builders/arjs/` and `builders/playcanvas/` to `builders/templates/quiz/arjs/` and `builders/templates/mmoomm/playcanvas/` for improved template reusability. Fixed all import paths, achieved zero TypeScript errors, and updated documentation with synchronized README files (506 lines each).

### 2025-01-27: Flowise 2.2.8 Platform Upgrade ✅

**Platform modernization completed** - Upgraded from 2.2.7-patch.1 to 2.2.8 with enhanced ASSISTANT type support, improved TypeScript compatibility, and preserved user isolation. Zero data loss, all builds successful.

### 2025-06-24: Profile-SRV Workspace Package Conversion ✅

**Workspace package architecture implemented** - Converted apps/profile-srv to scoped package `@universo/profile-srv` with clean imports, eliminated complex relative paths, prepared for future plugin architecture.

### 2025-01-26: Universal UPDL Data Extraction Fix ✅

**Multi-object spaces enhancement** - Fixed buildUPDLSpaceFromNodes data extraction with corrected field mapping, position handling, and color format. Maintained architectural separation between universal UPDL and AR.js-specific logic.

### 2024-12-19: Documentation QA & Code Cleanup ✅

**Documentation verification completed** - Corrected app structure documentation, clarified interface architecture (UPDLInterfaces.ts vs Interface.UPDL.ts), verified directory structures.

**Code refactoring completed** - Cleaned ARJSPublishApi.ts and ARJSPublisher.jsx, removed redundant code while preserving demo functionality and streaming pipeline.

### 2025-06-30: Template-Based Export Architecture & Documentation Sync ✅

**Major refactor finalized** - Implemented fully modular template architecture (`AbstractTemplateBuilder`, `TemplateRegistry`, updated `ARJSBuilder`). Added `ARJSQuizBuilder` as first concrete template. English and Russian READMEs synchronized line-by-line.
