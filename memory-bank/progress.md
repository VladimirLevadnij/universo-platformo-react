## Stage 2 Issues & Lessons Learned

The initial AR.js implementation faced several challenges:

1. **Complex architecture**: The hybrid approach with both client and server generation proved too complex for the initial MVP
2. **Unclear separation**: AR.js and A-Frame technologies were not clearly separated in the codebase
3. **Disconnected components**: UPDL nodes were not properly connected to the publication flow
4. **Build process issues**: Publication worked in development mode but failed in production builds
5. **Localization structure issues**: Improper organization of i18n keys caused display problems in UI components
6. **Unnecessary complexity in UPDL**: Export/publication functionality duplicated logic found in Flowise core

These insights informed our revised approach for Stage 3, leading to the simplified architecture we now have.

## Recent Major Achievements

### ✅ UPDL Applications Complete Refactoring (Completed)

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**

-   **Removed updl-srv entirely** - Flowise server provides all needed backend functionality
-   **Renamed updl-frt to updl** - Simplified naming without corresponding server app
-   **Cleaned UPDL from export/publication logic** - Streamlined to pure node definitions only
-   **Verified system integrity** - All builds pass, UPDL nodes work correctly

**Final Architecture:**

```
apps/
├── updl/           # Pure UPDL node definitions
├── publish-frt/    # Publication frontend
└── publish-srv/    # Publication backend
```

### Application Structure Refactoring (Completed)

-   **Standardized directory structure** across all applications
-   **Features migration** from miniapps → features in publish-frt
-   **Asset management improvement** with dedicated directories
-   **REST API communication** between applications with type-safe clients
-   **Documentation updates** reflecting current architecture

## Current Status ✅ **ALPHA ACHIEVED**

**Platform Status:** **Alpha v0.20.0** - Production-ready stability achieved (July 2025)

**Core Foundation Completed:**

-   ✅ APPs architecture with 6 working applications
-   ✅ High-level UPDL node system (7 core abstract nodes)
-   ✅ Multi-technology export (AR.js, PlayCanvas)
-   ✅ Template-first architecture with reusable templates
-   ✅ Supabase multi-user authentication with enhanced profiles
-   ✅ Universo MMOOMM foundation for MMO development

**Architecture Principles:**

-   **UPDL** → Universal abstract nodes for cross-platform development
-   **Template System** → Reusable export templates across technologies
-   **Multi-Technology** → AR.js (production), PlayCanvas (ready), extensible architecture
-   **Flowise 2.2.8** → Enhanced platform with TypeScript modernization

**Current Focus:**

-   Advanced UPDL node functionality and export template development
-   Universo MMOOMM implementation with PlayCanvas
-   Production deployment and user experience optimization

## UPDL Architecture Simplification ✅

**Key Changes:**

1. **Eliminated updl-srv** - Flowise server provides all backend functionality
2. **Simplified updl app** - Pure node definitions only, removed export/publication logic
3. **Verified system integrity** - All builds pass, no regressions

**Impact:** Clean separation of concerns, reduced code duplication, simplified maintenance.

# Progress Log

## Latest Achievements

### 2025-01-27: MMOOMM Template Ship Movement & Console Optimization ✅

**PlayCanvas MMOOMM template stabilized** - Fixed critical ship movement issues and optimized console logging for local development. Implemented physics body initialization with direct movement fallback, eliminated repetitive error message spam, and optimized WebSocket connection logging. Ship now responds smoothly to WASD+QZ controls with clean console output and transparent fallback system.

### 2025-01-27: Template-First Architecture Refactoring ✅

**Publication system architecture modernized** - Successfully migrated from technology-first structure to template-first structure in `publish-frt` application. Changed from `builders/arjs/` and `builders/playcanvas/` to `builders/templates/quiz/arjs/` and `builders/templates/mmoomm/playcanvas/` for improved template reusability. Fixed all import paths, achieved zero TypeScript errors, and updated documentation with synchronized README files (506 lines each).

### 2025-01-27: Flowise 2.2.8 Platform Upgrade ✅

**Platform modernization completed** - Upgraded from 2.2.7-patch.1 to 2.2.8 with enhanced ASSISTANT type support, improved TypeScript compatibility, and preserved user isolation. Zero data loss, all builds successful.

### 2025-06-24: Profile-SRV Workspace Package Conversion ✅

**Workspace package architecture implemented** - Converted apps/profile-srv to scoped package `@universo/profile-srv` with clean imports, eliminated complex relative paths, prepared for future plugin architecture.

### 2025-01-26: Universal UPDL Data Extraction Fix ✅

**Multi-object spaces enhancement** - Fixed buildUPDLSpaceFromNodes data extraction with corrected field mapping, position handling, and color format. Maintained architectural separation between universal UPDL and AR.js-specific logic.

### 2024-12-19: Documentation QA & Code Cleanup ✅

**Documentation verification completed** - Corrected app structure documentation, clarified interface architecture (UPDLInterfaces.ts vs Interface.UPDL.ts), verified directory structures.

**Code refactoring completed** - Cleaned ARJSPublishApi.ts and ARJSPublisher.jsx, removed redundant code while preserving demo functionality and streaming pipeline.

### 2025-06-30: Template-Based Export Architecture & Documentation Sync ✅

**Major refactor finalized** - Implemented fully modular template architecture (`AbstractTemplateBuilder`, `TemplateRegistry`, updated `ARJSBuilder`). Added `ARJSQuizBuilder` as first concrete template. English and Russian READMEs synchronized line-by-line.
