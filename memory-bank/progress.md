## Stage 2 Issues & Lessons Learned

The initial AR.js implementation faced several challenges:

1. **Complex architecture**: The hybrid approach with both client and server generation proved too complex for the initial MVP
2. **Unclear separation**: AR.js and A-Frame technologies were not clearly separated in the codebase
3. **Disconnected components**: UPDL nodes were not properly connected to the publication flow
4. **Build process issues**: Publication worked in development mode but failed in production builds
5. **Localization structure issues**: Improper organization of i18n keys caused display problems in UI components
6. **Unnecessary complexity in UPDL**: Export/publication functionality duplicated logic found in Flowise core

These insights informed our revised approach for Stage 3, leading to the simplified architecture we now have.

-   Full monorepo build green for types/utils/publish-srv

### ✅ 2025‑08‑13: Space Builder — Multi‑provider Test Mode & UI Enforcement

-   Server: `/config` returns `{ testMode, disableUserCredentials, items[] }`; items are generated from per‑provider env without defaults and sorted; legacy `groq_test` allowed only when fully configured
-   Provider calls unified via OpenAI‑compatible client (`baseURL + apiKey`), supports OpenAI, OpenRouter (extra headers), Groq, Cerebras, GigaChat, YandexGPT, Google, and Custom
-   UI: authorized `/config` fetch with 401 refresh; when credentials are disabled — only test models are visible and enforced; otherwise UI merges models and removes duplicates by label
-   Documentation: EN/RU docs updated in `docs/en|ru/applications/space-builder/README.md` and app READMEs (frt/srv)

### ✅ AR.js Wallpaper Mode (Markerless) — Frontend + Server + Docs (2025‑08‑12)

Delivered a markerless AR background option for quizzes:

-   UI: `AR Display Type` (default wallpaper), `Wallpaper type` selector, marker controls hidden when wallpaper; disabled techs visually dimmed
-   Persistence: `arDisplayType`/`wallpaperType` stored in `chatbotConfig.arjs`; publish request passes `renderConfig`
-   Backend: `FlowDataService` extracts `renderConfig`; public endpoint returns it
-   Builder: Markerless generation in `ARJSQuizBuilder` using animated wireframe sphere (rotation `dur: 90000`)
-   Public View: `ARViewPage` reads `renderConfig`, falls back to marker when missing
-   Documentation: Updated app READMEs (EN/RU) and `docs/en|ru/applications/publish/README.md`

### ✅ UPDL Applications Complete Refactoring (Completed)

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**

-   **Removed updl-srv entirely** - Flowise server provides all needed backend functionality
-   **Renamed updl-frt to updl** - Simplified naming without corresponding server app
-   **Cleaned UPDL from export/publication logic** - Streamlined to pure node definitions only
-   **Verified system integrity** - All builds pass, UPDL nodes work correctly

**Final Architecture:**

```
apps/
├── updl/           # Pure UPDL node definitions
├── publish-frt/    # Publication frontend
└── publish-srv/    # Publication backend
```

### Application Structure Refactoring (Completed)

-   **Standardized directory structure** across all applications
-   **Features migration** from miniapps → features in publish-frt
-   **Asset management improvement** with dedicated directories
-   **REST API communication** between applications with type-safe clients
-   **Documentation updates** reflecting current architecture

### 2025-08-31: Build Order Stabilization, i18n TS Unification, and Finance Integration ✅

-   Enforced correct build sequence by declaring workspace dependencies in `packages/ui` for `@universo/template-quiz`, `@universo/template-mmoomm`, and `publish-frt`, leveraging Turborepo `dependsOn: ["^build"]`.
-   Removed a circular dependency by deleting `flowise-ui` from `apps/finance-frt/base/package.json`.
-   Migrated i18n entry points to TypeScript for consistent ESM/CJS output and type-safety (`template-quiz`, `template-mmoomm`, `publish-frt`).
-   Verified template package `exports` map and ensured `dist/esm`, `dist/cjs`, `dist/types` are produced; `publish-frt` consumes template type declarations from `dist`.
-   Integrated Finance apps: server routes, entities, and migrations wired; UI routes added; i18n `finance` namespace loaded.
-   Outcome: `pnpm build:clean` + full `pnpm build` complete successfully; Vite resolves template entries without errors.

## Recently Completed Enhancements

### 2025-08-07: Uniks Functionality Extraction and Build System Fixes

Successfully extracted Uniks (workspace) functionality from monolithic codebase into dedicated packages `@universo/uniks-srv` and `@universo/uniks-frt`, resolving critical build system issues. Implemented modular architecture with clean separation of concerns, eliminated circular dependencies, fixed TypeScript compilation issues, and corrected internationalization configuration. All packages build successfully with improved maintainability and scalability. See [archive entry](../docs/archive/enhancements/2025-08/uniks-functionality-extraction.md) for complete documentation.

### 2025-08-06: MMOOMM Entity Hardcode Elimination Fix

Successfully eliminated all hardcoded transform values in MMOOMM Entity types that were overriding UPDL settings from Chatflow. Fixed JavaScript variable scope conflicts and preserved all game functionality. See [archive entry](../docs/archive/enhancements/2025-08/mmoomm-entity-hardcode-elimination-fix.md) for complete documentation.

### 2025-08-20: UPDL Objects Fix in Multiplayer Mode ✅

Successfully fixed critical UPDL object extraction and transmission in multiplayer MMOOMM mode:

-   Fixed UPDLProcessor.analyzeSpaceChain() to properly include entities in spaceData for multi-scene flows
-   Corrected entity data extraction from entity.data.inputs instead of entity.data
-   Enhanced PlayCanvasMMOOMMBuilder with comprehensive logging and validation
-   Improved MMOOMMRoom server-side entity processing with detailed debugging
-   Verified complete UPDL Flow → Multiplayer → Objects in game cycle
-   Confirmed backward compatibility with single-player mode
-   **Impact**: UPDL Flow objects now correctly appear in multiplayer games (7 entities: ship, station, 4 asteroids, gate) with proper positions and types instead of default fallback objects

### 2025-08-14: Auth System PoC (Passport.js + Supabase) — Isolated ✅

-   Implemented an isolated authentication PoC:
    -   Server `apps/auth-srv/base`: Passport LocalStrategy, server-side sessions (HttpOnly cookies), CSRF, rate-limit, session fixation mitigation, per-request Supabase client with RLS, automatic token refresh (single-flight), safe logout (setSession + signOut)
    -   Frontend `apps/auth-frt/base`: React + Vite minimal client using cookie session and `X-CSRF-Token`; no tokens stored client-side
-   Build: both packages compile successfully with PNPM workspace
-   Documentation: RU/EN READMEs with step-by-step rollout plan
-   Important: Code is fully isolated and NOT integrated into the current system yet. No changes to existing routes or UI.

### 2025-09-07: Spaces + Canvases Refactor (Phase 1–2) ✅

- Fixed Canvas state race by guarding legacy Chatflow effects when `spaceId` is present; Active Canvas now consistently hydrates from Spaces/Canvases.
- Tabs UX improved: subtle border for inactive tabs, 3px lift, spinner moved to the left with proper contrast on active tab; add button placed adjacent to tabs, smaller and with subdued colors.
- Local HTTP client for spaces‑frt (`src/api/client.js`) with JWT refresh; migrated Spaces/Canvases API modules.
- Local hooks in spaces‑frt (`useApi`, `useCanvases`); Flowise equivalents removed.
- UI updated to load Spaces from spaces‑frt in MainRoutes; Canvas routes restored under MinimalLayout via `apps/spaces-frt/base/src/entry/CanvasRoutes.jsx` and wired into UI router.
- Removed unused Flowise UI code and resolved Vite alias issues by switching remaining imports in spaces‑frt to relative paths.
