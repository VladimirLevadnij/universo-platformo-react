# Task Tracking

**Project**: Universo Platformo (v0.21.0-alpha, Alpha achieved)
**Current Focus**: Post-alpha feature development (UPDL expansions, MMOOMM)

## Current Implementation Tasks

### MMOOMM Template Refactoring - Safe Cleanup Phase ✅ COMPLETE

-   [x] Verify current laser system functionality: Test that current laser mining system in ship.ts works correctly before removing backup files
-   [x] Remove laserSystem_design.js: Delete obsolete design file from entityTypes directory
-   [x] Remove ship_weaponSystem_backup.js: Delete obsolete backup file from entityTypes directory
-   [x] Test MMOOMM template build: Verify that MMOOMM template builds successfully after file removal

### MMOOMM Template Refactoring - Inventory Consolidation Phase (MVP) ✅ COMPLETE

-   [x] Create shared inventory template: Create shared/inventoryTemplate.ts with minimal working implementation
-   [x] Update attachments/inventory.ts: Replace duplicated code with shared template reference (preserves UPDL Component integration)
-   [x] Update components/inventory.ts: Update components/inventory.ts to use shared template while preserving logging and events functionality
-   [x] Test inventory functionality: Verify that laser mining and UPDL Component attachment still work correctly

## Recently Completed Tasks

-   [x] **Laser System Critical Fix (v0.21.3-alpha)**: Fixed critical recursive initialization error and visual artifacts in laser mining system (2025-01-29)
    -   Fixed recursive `this.laserSystem.init()` call causing black screen crashes
    -   Replaced complex line mesh with reliable box model for laser beam rendering
    -   Fixed update loop using `app.on('update')` instead of `entity.on('update')`
    -   Added missing `getItemList()` method to ship inventory for HUD updates
    -   Removed fade-out animation to prevent laser beam detachment during ship movement
-   [x] **Laser Mining System (v0.21.2-alpha)**: Industrial laser mining implementation with auto-targeting and state machine (2025-01-28)
    -   Replaced projectile weapons with industrial laser mining system
