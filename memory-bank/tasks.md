### UPDL & Publication System

**Publication System Documentation Update** âœ… **NEW**

-   **Architecture Analysis**: Conducted a deep analysis of the `publish-frt` application's new architecture.
-   **README Update**: Fully updated `README.md` and `README-RU.md` to reflect the template-based builder system, PlayCanvas integration, and multi-technology API.
-   **Structural Integrity**: Ensured both README files have identical structure and line count for consistency.
-   **Key Features Documented**: Added detailed sections for `PlayCanvasBuilder`, the `mmoomm` template, `PublicationApi`, and the overall workflow for multi-technology publishing.

**Template-First Architecture Refactoring** âœ… **NEW**

-   **Architecture Paradigm Shift**: Successfully migrated from technology-first structure (`arjs/`, `playcanvas/`) to template-first structure (`templates/quiz/arjs/`, `templates/mmoomm/playcanvas/`).
-   **File Structure Reorganization**: Reorganized builders directory with proper template-based hierarchy for improved code organization and template reusability.
-   **Import Path Corrections**: Fixed all TypeScript imports and exports to work with the new directory structure, maintaining clean compilation.
-   **Build System Validation**: Verified complete project builds successfully with zero TypeScript errors after the refactoring.
-   **Documentation Synchronization**: Updated both English and Russian README files with identical structure (506 lines each) reflecting the new architecture.
-   **Template Reusability**: Enabled template reuse across multiple technologies, allowing templates to be implemented with different engines (e.g., `quiz` template with both AR.js and future PlayCanvas implementations).

**Publication System Refactoring** âœ…

-   Successfully refactored `publish-srv` into a modular `@universo/publish-srv` workspace package.
-   Decoupled frontend/backend by moving all UPDL processing logic from the server-side `buildUPDLflow.ts` to a new client-side `UPDLProcessor.ts` in the `publish-frt` application.
-   Centralized all UPDL-related TypeScript types in `@universo/publish-srv`, which now acts as the single source of truth.
-   Completely removed the legacy `packages/server/src/Interface.UPDL.ts` file after updating all dependencies.
-   Streamlined the backend's responsibility to only serving raw `flowData`, enhancing performance and modularity.

**UPDL Quiz System** âœ…

-   **Localization Enhancement**: Added missing `publish.playcanvas.loading` translation keys in both English and Russian localization files for complete multilingual support.
-   **PlayCanvasViewPage Architecture Refactoring**: Migrated from direct `PlayCanvasMMOOMMBuilder` import to `TemplateRegistry` usage, enabling dynamic template selection via `config.templateId` parameter and improving extensibility.
-   **Backend Fetch Optimization**: Added `ENABLE_BACKEND_FETCH` feature flag (default: false) for optional backend data fetching. When disabled, component expects data via props, improving security and reliability.
-   **Modern Iframe Implementation**: Upgraded both `ARViewPage` and `PlayCanvasViewPage` from legacy `iframe.contentDocument.write()` approach to modern `iframe.srcdoc` attribute for improved performance and browser compatibility.
-   **Documentation Comprehensive Update**: Enhanced README files in both English and Russian with identical structure and content. Updated UPDL documentation with detailed table of 7 core high-level nodes (Space, Entity, Component, Event, Action, Data, Universo) and marked legacy nodes (Object, Camera, Light) for deprecation. Added detailed exclusive publication logic documentation to publish-frt README files. All changes maintain careful preservation of existing important information.

## ðŸ”§ RECENT COMPLETION (January 2025)

### High-Level UPDL System Refactoring & Fixes âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETED - All 7 core abstract nodes fully refactored and operational  
**Achievement**: Established a robust, intuitive, and visually distinct node system for the Universo MMOOMM pipeline. Fixed all connector and icon issues for seamless visual programming.

#### Key Deliverables:

1. **âœ… Node Connector Logic Fixed**

    - **Input Connectors**: Successfully established the correct connection logic. Nodes now correctly accept specific child node types (e.g., `Entity` accepts `Component` and `Event`) by defining them in the `inputs` array of the node's class definition.
    - **Output Connectors**: Resolved a critical bug where output connectors were not appearing. The issue was traced to an incorrect attempt to standardize output creation in `BaseUPDLNode.ts`. The fix was to remove this and rely on Flowise's default behavior, which automatically creates a standard output if the `outputs: []` array is empty.

2. **âœ… Codebase & Architecture Unified**

    - **BaseUPDLNode.ts**: Refactored to remove faulty output logic. A new constant array, `CONNECTABLE_TYPES`, was introduced to centralize the list of all connectable UPDL node types, improving maintainability.
    - **ActionNode.ts**: Completely redesigned. All input connectors (`Data Params`, `Target`) were removed in favor of internal configuration fields. This simplifies the user experience, as all logic is now self-contained within the node's settings panel.
    - **UniversoNode.ts**: Simplified by removing all input connectors, reinforcing its role as a global configuration node.

3. **âœ… Unique Visual Identity for All Nodes**

    - **Custom Icons**: Replaced all placeholder icons with unique, meaningful SVG icons for each of the 7 core nodes (`Space`, `Entity`, `Component`, `Event`, `Action`, `Data`, `Universo`). This greatly improves the visual clarity of the editor.
    - **Icon Cleanup**: The icon for the `Data` node was refined for better visual consistency.

#### Architectural Benefits:

-   âœ… **Correct Visual Programming**: All nodes now connect logically and intuitively on the Flowise canvas.
-   âœ… **Simplified Node Configuration**: The `Action` node is now much easier to configure.
-   âœ… **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized connector types and a cleaner base class make future development easier.
-   âœ… **Enhanced User Experience**: Unique icons provide immediate visual identification for each node's function.
-   âœ… **Ready for Next Stage**: The UPDL system is now stable and ready for the development of the PlayCanvas export template.

#### Correct Connector Structure:

-   **Entity** accepts: `Component`, `Event`
-   **Component** outputs: `UPDLComponent` (connects to Entity)
-   **Event** accepts: `Action`; outputs: `UPDLEvent` (connects to Entity)
-   **Action** has no inputs/outputs; it is a terminal node configured internally. Connects to `Event`.
-   **Space** accepts: `Entity`, `Universo`, and legacy nodes (`Object`, `Camera`, `Light`, `Data`)
-   **Data** can be chained; is accepted by `Action` via internal configuration, not a direct connection.
-   **Universo** connects to `Space` to provide global context.

    -   **Output Connectors**: Fixed critical bug with missing outputs. Issue was caused by incorrect standardization in `BaseUPDLNode.ts`. Solution: remove custom logic and use Flowise default behavior (empty `outputs: []` array).

2.  **âœ… Architecture Unified**

    -   **BaseUPDLNode.ts**: Extracted connector type logic into `CONNECTABLE_TYPES` constant array for simplified maintenance.
    -   **ActionNode.ts**: Completely redesigned. Input connectors removed in favor of internal configuration fields, simplifying setup.
    -   **UniversoNode.ts**: Simplified by removing all input connectors.

3.  **âœ… Unique Icons for All Nodes**
    -   All seven core nodes (`Space`, `Entity`, `Component`, `Event`, `Action`, `Data`, `Universo`) received unique and intuitive SVG icons, improving visual navigation.

#### Architectural Benefits:

-   âœ… All nodes now connect correctly and logically on the canvas.
-   âœ… Simplified `Action` node configuration.
-   âœ… Improved code maintainability through type centralization and clean base.
