# Tasks for Stage 3

## Current Focus

Develop complex UPDL structures in Chatflow that support:

-   Multiple objects in single space
-   Multiple connected spaces (Space nodes)
-   Advanced AR.js publication/export functionality

### Legend

-   [~] In Progress
-   [x] Completed
-   [! ] Blocked / Needs Decision
-   [ðŸŽ¨] Creative Phase Complete

## Level 1 â€“ Core Functionality

-   [x] **âœ… Project Architecture & Structure** - Complete reorganization of apps structure, REST API communication, proper typing, documentation updates

-   [x] **âœ… AR.js Publication & Supabase Integration** - Multi-technology publication architecture, persistent settings, correct API routes, UI/UX improvements

-   [x] **âœ… UPDL Data Integration** - UPDL nodes integration with Flowise, streaming generation, publish-srv integration

-   [~] **AR.js Streaming Generation**

    -   [~] Generation type selection (Streaming/Pre-generation)
    -   [~] Client-side generation flow for `/p/{uuid}`
    -   [~] UI adaptation for streaming mode

-   [ ] **Publication Interface Mode Switching**

    -   [ ] Fix ChatBot/AR.js mode switching in APICodeDialog.jsx
    -   [ ] Test mode switching functionality
    -   [ ] Add error handling for mode transitions

-   [ ] **AR.js Basic Publication Testing**
    -   [ ] Create test UPDL scene (Scene â†’ Box objects)
    -   [ ] Test full publication workflow
    -   [ ] Verify scene display with markers

## Level 2 â€“ User Experience

-   [x] **âœ… Enhanced Publication UI** - QR codes, marker display, notifications, tooltips

-   [x] **âœ… Restructured Publication Interface** - Tab reorganization, scrollable layout, form validation

-   [~] **Publication Flow Optimization**

    -   [~] Caching implementation
    -   [~] Progressive loading for AR.js scenes
    -   [x] Error handling improvements

-   [x] **âœ… Multi-Object UPDL Support** - COMPLETED: Fixed data extraction in buildUPDLflow.ts, implemented circular positioning in ObjectHandler, added validation with SimpleValidator, and basic logging. Multiple objects now render correctly in AR.js with proper positioning to prevent overlaps.

## Creative Phase Decisions

### ðŸŽ¨ PositionManager Architecture

-   **Algorithm**: Circular layout with adaptive radius
-   **Features**: Respects manual positions, automatic object separation
-   **Integration**: buildUPDLSpaceFromNodes + ARJSBuilder

### ðŸŽ¨ MultiObjectValidator Data Model

-   **Approach**: Custom validation classes (ColorValidator, PositionValidator, ObjectValidator, SpaceValidator)
-   **Features**: UPDL-specific validation, detailed error reporting
-   **Performance**: Optimized for streaming mode

### ðŸŽ¨ Performance Optimization Algorithm

-   **Primary**: Caching with smart invalidation (hash-based cache keys)
-   **Secondary**: Object batching for identical objects (>3 instances)
-   **Metrics**: Processing time tracking, cache hit rates
