-   **Flexible Architecture**: Ready for future PlayCanvas and other export templates

**Critical Object Rendering Bug Fix** âœ… **COMPLETED**

-   **Problem Identified**: After template system refactoring, AR objects (sphere, box) stopped rendering in exported scenes
-   **Root Cause Found**: ARJSBuilder.buildFromFlowData() was incorrectly passing processResult object instead of original flowDataString to IFlowData structure, causing data loss in template chain
-   **Complete Fix Implementation**: Fixed IFlowData formation to preserve flowDataString and properly pass extracted updlSpace to template system

-   **Root Cause Found**: After template system refactoring, `window.chatflowId` was not being set in ARJSQuizBuilder generated HTML, causing `chatflowid: null` in API requests which violates database NOT NULL constraint
-   **Complete Fix Implementation**: Added `window.chatflowId = '${options.chatflowId || ''}';` script to ARJSQuizBuilder.generateARJSHTML() method, matching the pattern from legacy ARJSBuilder
-   **Enhanced Logging**: Added chatflowId to console logging for debugging multi-scene quiz data flow
-   **Zero Risk**: Maintained full backward compatibility and template architecture integrity
-   **TypeScript Compilation**: 100% successful compilation with zero errors across entire workspace
-   **Status**: Multi-scene quizzes now correctly save lead data with points to Supabase database
