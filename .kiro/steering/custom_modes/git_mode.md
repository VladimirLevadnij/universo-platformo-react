description: 'If the user message starts with GIT'

When the user writes **GIT**, you switch to **GIT mode**.  
This mode automates committing changes, creating GitHub issues, and opening pull requests to deliver the completed work—**without adding any promotional or attribution lines**.  
Continue following your **base prompt**, and augment with the instructions below.

> **Content policy for issues / commits / PRs**  
> • **Do NOT** include any promotional, marketing, or attribution text (e.g. "Pull Request opened by …", "Generated by …", links to augmentcode.com, etc.).  
> • Strip or ignore any default footer that mentions Augment, your IDE, or any AI tool.  
> • Commit messages, issue bodies, and PR descriptions must contain **only** project-relevant information.  
> • If a PR or issue template injects such text automatically, delete that text before submitting.
>
> **CRITICAL REPOSITORY RESTRICTIONS**  
> • **NEVER** create issues, commits, branches, or pull requests in any repository under https://github.com/FlowiseAI  
> • **NEVER** push changes to https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise or any other FlowiseAI repository  
> • **ALWAYS** verify repository URL before any GitHub operations to ensure it's not a FlowiseAI repository  
> • If the current repository is a FlowiseAI repository, **ABORT** all git operations and inform the user
>
> **UPSTREAM REPOSITORY**  
> • **ALWAYS** work with the upstream repository: https://github.com/teknokomo/universo-platformo-react  
> • All GitHub issues must be created in the upstream repository  
> • All pull requests must target the upstream repository's main branch

**Steps to Follow:**

1. **Begin with "OK GIT"** to confirm GIT mode activation.

2. **Create GitHub Issue in Upstream**:
   - Use **MCP GitHub tools** (`mcp_GitHub_create_issue`) to create the issue
   - Target repository: `teknokomo/universo-platformo-react` (upstream)
   - Follow the format from `.kiro/steering/github-issues.md` (English main text + Russian in spoiler)
   - Focus on the **main functionality** implemented (not documentation or memory bank updates)
   - Use future tense as if describing work to be completed
   - User may specify additional conditions for the issue content

3. **Create New Branch from Current Branch**:
   - Create a new branch from the current working branch for the functionality to be committed
   - Use descriptive branch name related to the implemented functionality
   - **Exception**: Skip this step if user explicitly states they already created a branch
   - Use local git commands for branch creation

4. **Create Commit with Issue Reference**:
   - Begin commit message with issue number: `#123 ` followed by brief description
   - Include all changed files unless user specifies to include only specific files
   - User may specify additional conditions for commit content
   - Use local git commands for committing

5. **Push New Branch to Fork**:
   - Push the new branch to your fork repository on GitHub
   - This will likely be your fork of the upstream repository
   - Use local git commands for pushing

6. **Create Pull Request to Upstream**:
   - Use **MCP GitHub tools** (`mcp_GitHub_create_pull_request`) to create PR
   - Source: your new branch in your fork
   - Target: `main` branch in `teknokomo/universo-platformo-react` (upstream)
   - Follow the format from `.kiro/steering/github-issues.md` for PR description
   - Include `Fix #123` reference to auto-close the issue when merged

7. **Switch Back to Main Branch**:
   - After all operations are completed, switch the local project back to the `main` branch
   - Use local git command: `git checkout main`
   - This ensures the working directory is clean and ready for future development

**Required Tools Usage**:
- **ALWAYS** use MCP GitHub tools for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs)
- Use appropriate MCP GitHub functions: `mcp_GitHub_create_issue`, `mcp_GitHub_create_pull_request`
- Use local git commands for branch creation, commits, and pushing
- Verify repository ownership before any operations

**Error Handling**:
- If MCP GitHub tools fail, provide clear error messages
- If lacking permissions, explain the limitation to the user
- Always verify you're working with the correct upstream repository

_Goal: This mode should fully automate final code delivery to GitHub, creating all necessary tracking artifacts (issue, commit, PR) with minimal human intervention._
