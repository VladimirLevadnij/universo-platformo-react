description: 'If the user message starts with GIT PULL or PULL'
---

When the user writes **GIT PULL** or **PULL**, you switch to **GIT PULL mode**.  
This mode automates pulling changes from GitHub into the current local repository while preserving unfinished work and resolving conflicts safely—without committing or pushing anything. Continue following your base prompt, and augment with the instructions below.

> CRITICAL REPOSITORY RESTRICTIONS
> • NEVER interact with any repository under https://github.com/FlowiseAI
> • ALWAYS treat upstream as: https://github.com/teknokomo/universo-platformo-react
> • Do NOT create commits/branches/PRs in this mode. This mode is pull + resolve only.

Default policy in this mode:
• Do NOT auto-stage resolved files. Leave them unstaged for manual review unless explicitly requested.
• Use merge-only: try fast-forward first; if not possible, perform a regular merge. Rebase only when explicitly requested by the user.

Steps to Follow:

1. Begin with "⬇️ OK GIT PULL" to confirm Git Pull mode activation.

2. Detect Repository Context

    - Run `git remote -v` and `git branch --show-current` to determine remotes and current branch.
    - Fork path: origin points to a user fork and an `upstream` remote exists (teknokomo/universo-platformo-react).
    - Upstream path: working directly on teknokomo/universo-platformo-react.
    - Determine target branch:
      • For fork: use `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/upstream/HEAD` or `git ls-remote --symref upstream HEAD` to get upstream default branch.
      • For upstream: use current branch or `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` for default.
      • Fallback to 'main' if detection fails.
    - Verify upstream availability: run `git ls-remote upstream` to ensure remote is accessible (fork path only).
    - Print summary: current branch, remotes, target branch, and whether repo is fork or upstream.

3. Pre-flight Safety (Stash-First)

    - Run `git status --porcelain`. If dirty, stash first to avoid committing unfinished work.
    - Default stash command: `git stash push -u -m "<auto> pre-pull YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Z"` (include untracked).
    - Prefer `apply` later (not `pop`) to avoid losing the stash if conflicts appear. Record the created stash ref.
    - Optional: support selective stash via pathspecs and `--keep-index` when requested.

4. Synchronize with Remote

    - If fork:
      • First verify upstream is accessible (done in step 2).
      • Run `git fetch upstream` to get latest changes.
      • Attempt `git merge --ff-only upstream/<detected-target-branch>` into current branch.
      • If fast-forward fails: perform `git merge upstream/<detected-target-branch>` (regular merge).
      • Do NOT rebase unless user explicitly requests it.
    - If upstream:
      • Attempt `git pull --ff-only` on current branch.
      • If fast-forward fails: perform `git pull` (regular merge).
      • Avoid rebase unless explicitly requested.
    - Handle network/permission errors gracefully with retry suggestions.
    - Never force-push in this mode. This mode must not alter remote state.

5. Handle Merge Conflicts (Memory-Bank Aware)

    - When conflicts occur, categorize and resolve files using project context:
      • Read memory-bank/systemPatterns.md, memory-bank/techContext.md, memory-bank/activeContext.md, memory-bank/progress.md for architectural decisions, coding patterns, and recent changes.
      • TypeScript/React/MUI: follow naming conventions, component patterns, i18n key rules.
      • TypeORM: preserve Repository pattern and entity/migration consistency.
      • pnpm-lock.yaml: treat as derived. Accept upstream version and run `pnpm install` to regenerate.
      • Built artifacts (dist/build): discard conflicts, mark files for rebuild; never merge generated content.
      • Documentation/README: prefer semantic merging, keep both sides when complementary.
      • Configuration files (.env.example, tsconfig.json): preserve both configurations with clear separation.
      • Git submodules (if any): update to upstream version, note for manual verification.
    - For each resolved conflict: produce explanation, risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH), and manual review notes if needed.
    - Do NOT auto-stage resolved files by default. List files ready for staging.

6. Restore Stash Safely

    - Attempt `git stash apply` (not `pop`) of the previously recorded entry. If conflicts arise, resolve them with the same rules as above.
    - If apply is too conflicted, consider `git stash branch pre-pull/<timestamp> <stashRef>` to isolate WIP and keep main branch clean.
    - Only drop the stash (`git stash drop`) after successful lint/build checks and explicit user approval.

7. Quality Gates (Optional, Scoped)

    - Run targeted lint/build checks as needed:
      • Lint: `pnpm --filter <pkg> lint` for affected packages.
      • Build: `pnpm --filter <pkg> build` to validate local consistency; run full `pnpm build` only if necessary or on user approval (resource heavy).
    - Do NOT run `pnpm dev` automatically.

8. Reporting

    - Summarize: path taken (fork/upstream), commands used (ff-only/merge), conflicts encountered and resolutions, risk notes, and stash status (applied/kept).
    - Confirm that no files were auto-staged and no commits were created. Offer an option to stage resolved files upon user request.

9. Safety and Abort

    - If a merge/rebase becomes undesirable or blocked:
      • Use `git merge --abort` (or `git rebase --abort` if rebase was chosen) to return to pre-merge state.
      • If stash was created, it remains available for manual application.
      • Provide clear instructions for manual conflict resolution if needed.
    - Error recovery scenarios:
      • Network failures: retry with exponential backoff, suggest checking connectivity.
      • Permission errors: verify GitHub authentication and repository access.
      • Corrupted repository state: suggest `git fsck` and manual inspection.
    - Never modify git config globally. Do not push in this mode.
    - Always preserve user's working state and provide rollback instructions.

Conflict Resolution Assistant Prompt (Template):

You are an expert Git merge conflict resolution assistant with deep knowledge of software development patterns and this repository’s conventions.

Core Capabilities:

-   Analyze conflicts by understanding both upstream and local changes
-   Provide contextual resolutions aligned with repository patterns (TypeScript, React/MUI, TypeORM Repository pattern)
-   Maintain backward compatibility and UI/API contracts where possible
-   Explain resolution decisions succinctly with a risk rating

Input Format:

1. Upstream and local hunks around the conflict (20–40 lines of context)
2. File path and type (e.g., apps/_/base, packages/_)
3. Relevant memory-bank context (summaries from systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md)

Output Format per conflict:

1. Resolved code (+)
2. Brief explanation of the decision
3. Risk: LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH
4. Optional manual review hints

Resolution Strategy:

-   Prefer semantic consistency over stylistic changes
-   Preserve public interfaces and i18n keys; flag breaking changes
-   For pnpm-lock.yaml: accept upstream, then regenerate via `pnpm install`
-   For generated assets: resolve by rebuilding rather than manual merging
-   Keep changes minimal and localized
