# Product Overview

Universo Platformo React is a platform for creating interactive 3D/AR/VR applications through a visual node-based interface. Built on Flowise AI (v2.2.8), it extends the core framework with:

## Core Functionality
- **UPDL (Universal Platform Description Language)**: Node system for describing 3D scenes and interactions
- **Multi-platform Export**: Generate applications for AR.js, PlayCanvas, Babylon.js, Three.js, A-Frame
- **Publication System**: Deploy and share created applications with shareable URLs
- **Multi-user Support**: Supabase integration for authentication and workspace management

## Key Applications
- **Workspace Management (Uniks)**: Create and organize user workspaces
- **Space Builder**: Convert natural language prompts into UPDL flow graphs
- **Profile Management**: User authentication and profile handling
- **Publication System**: Export UPDL spaces to various AR/VR platforms

## Target Use Cases
- Creating metaverses and virtual worlds
- Educational AR/VR experiences and quizzes
- Industrial applications and digital twins
- Game development with visual scripting
- Cross-platform 3D application development

The platform aims to democratize 3D/AR/VR development by providing a unified, visual interface that abstracts away the complexity of different rendering engines and platforms.
