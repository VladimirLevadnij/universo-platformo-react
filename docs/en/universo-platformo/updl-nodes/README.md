# UPDL Node System

> **üìã Notice**: This documentation is based on the original Flowise documentation and is currently being adapted for Universo Platformo React. Some sections may still reference Flowise functionality that has not yet been fully updated for Universo Platformo-specific features.

The Universal Platform Description Language (UPDL) Node System is the core of Universo Platformo's 3D/AR/VR content creation capabilities.

## Overview

UPDL provides a visual, node-based approach to creating complex 3D/AR/VR experiences. Each node type serves a specific purpose in building immersive digital environments.

## Node Categories

### Space Nodes

**Key Features:**
- Environment setup and configuration
- Lighting and atmosphere control
- Physics world initialization
- Spatial boundaries definition

**Use Cases:**
- Creating game worlds
- Setting up AR/VR environments
- Defining interaction spaces

### Entity Nodes
Create interactive objects, characters, and elements within your spaces.

**Key Features:**
- 3D model loading and management
- Character creation and animation
- Interactive object definition
- Asset management

**Use Cases:**
- Player characters and NPCs
- Interactive objects and items
- Environmental elements
- Collectible resources

## Integration with Flowise

UPDL nodes seamlessly integrate with existing Flowise nodes:

- **Chat Models** can drive NPC conversations
- **Tools** can be used for external API integration
- **Memory** systems can store player progress
- **Embeddings** can power semantic search in game content

## Best Practices

### Node Organization
- Group related nodes logically
- Use clear naming conventions
- Document complex flows
- Maintain consistent data flow patterns

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize unnecessary node connections
- Use efficient data structures
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Consider platform-specific optimizations

### Debugging and Testing
- Use built-in debugging tools
- Test on target platforms early
- Monitor performance metrics
- Validate user interactions

## Getting Started

1. **Start with Space Nodes** - Define your environment
2. **Add Entity Nodes** - Create objects and characters
3. **Attach Components** - Add behaviors and properties
4. **Define Actions** - Implement interactions
5. **Handle Events** - Manage user input and system events
6. **Manage Data** - Store and retrieve information

## Advanced Topics
