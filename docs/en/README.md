# Introduction

> **ðŸ“‹ Notice**: This documentation is based on the original Flowise documentation and is currently being adapted for Universo Platformo React. Some sections may still reference Flowise functionality that has not yet been fully updated for Universo Platformo-specific features.

Universo Platformo React is an advanced open source platform built upon Flowise, extending it for building AI Agents, LLM workflows, and immersive 3D/AR/VR experiences.

It offers a complete solution that includes:

* [x] Visual Builder (inherited from Flowise)
* [x] Tracing & Analytics
* [x] Evaluations
* [x] Human in the Loop
* [x] API, CLI, SDK, Embedded Chatbot
* [x] Teams & Workspaces
* [x] **UPDL Node System** - Universal Platform Description Language
* [x] **MMOOMM Templates** - Massive Multiplayer Online Open Metaverse
* [x] **Multi-Platform Export** - AR.js, PlayCanvas, A-Frame support
* [x] **Enhanced Resource Systems** - Advanced resource management

## Spaces + Canvases Refactor (2025â€‘09)

We began decoupling Spaces from legacy Flowise UI into a dedicated pair of applications:

- `apps/spaces-srv` â€” backend for Spaces/Canvases (TypeORM entities, reorder endpoints)
- `apps/spaces-frt` â€” frontend with multiâ€‘canvas tabs, drag & drop, and an isolated HTTP client

Key changes:
- The UI now loads the Spaces list from `apps/spaces-frt`.
- Canvas routes are handled under MinimalLayout via `apps/spaces-frt/base/src/entry/CanvasRoutes.jsx`, so the canvas page does not show the main left menu.
- Local hooks (`useApi`, `useCanvases`) and a local Axios client remove tight coupling to Flowise UI.
- Unused Flowise UI files were removed to reduce noise and alias conflicts.

There are 3 main visual builders namely:

* Assistant
* Chatflow
* Agentflow

## Assistant

Assistant is the most begineer-friendly way of creating an AI Agent. Users can create chat assistant that is able to follow instructions, use tools when neccessary, and retrieve knowledge base from uploaded files ([RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation)) to respond to user queries.

## Chatflow

Chatflow is designed to build single-agent systems, chatbots and simple LLM flows. It is more flexible than Assistant. Users can use advance techniques like Graph RAG, Reranker, Retriever, etc.

## Agentflow

Agentflow is the superset of Chatflow & Assistant. It can be used to create chat assistant, single-agent system, multi-agent systems, and complex workflow orchestration. Learn more [Agentflow V2](using-flowise/agentflowv2.md)
