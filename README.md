## Basic Information

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0be3687e-afe2-46be-a0f6-487ff03d9c80)

Implementation of Universo Platformo / Universo MMOOMM / Universo Kiberplano built on React and related stack. This project is based on [Flowise AI](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise) (version 2.2.8) with multi-user functionality through Supabase integration and extended with UPDL (Universal Platform Description Language) for creating 3D/AR/VR applications.

**In this repository, public efforts are currently underway to create Universo Platformo / Universo MMOOMM, in order to launch a global teknokomization and save humanity from final enslavement and complete destruction by creating special mass multi-user virtual worlds, such as Universo MMOOMM, and a platform for their creation - Universo Platformo, initially with gaming functionality, and then with the addition of the Cyberplan functionality.**

Universo Platformo React serves as the foundation for implementing **Universo Kiberplano** - a global planning and implementation system that unifies plans, tasks, and resources while controlling robots. This system aims to create a comprehensive framework for worldwide coordination of efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and enabling efficient automation through robotic systems, all within a unified digital environment.

More details about all this are written in "The Book of The Future" and various other materials of ours, most of which are still poorly structured and not in English, but right now work is underway to create new detailed documentation, which will be presented in many languages.

## Inspiration

Our wonderful project, which will help create a global teknokomization and save humanity from final enslavement and total destruction, is currently in pre-alpha stage. We are implementing a React-based version of Universo Platformo that will serve as a foundation for creating interactive 3D/AR/VR experiences.

This implementation focuses on extending Flowise AI with UPDL (Universal Platform Description Language) to enable the creation of cross-platform 3D applications through a visual node-based interface.

## Where Am I and What Should I Do?

The near future, Omsk is the capital of the world, in the Olympus-1 tower, scientists explain to you that it is possible to connect your consciousness to a robot in another part of the Universe, in a parallel reality, controlled by robots we call Robocubans, through the recently discovered Great Ring system.

In Universo Platformo React, you are at the control panel of this revolutionary technology. Through the visual node editor, you can create interactive 3D scenes, AR experiences, and VR worlds that bridge our reality with parallel universes.

Your mission is to help build and expand this platform, creating new exporters, enhancing the node system, and contributing to the publication mechanism that will allow these experiences to be shared across the multiverse.

This structure allows for:

-   **Modularity**: Each functional area is contained within its own application
-   **Minimal Core Changes**: Original Flowise code remains largely untouched
-   **Easy Extension**: New technologies can be added as miniapps
-   **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between different functional areas

## Features

### UPDL Node System

The Universal Platform Description Language (UPDL) provides a unified way to describe 3D scenes and interactions:

-   **Scene Nodes**: Define the environment and root container
-   **Object Nodes**: 3D models, primitives with materials and transformations
-   **Camera Nodes**: Different camera types with configurable properties
-   **Light Nodes**: Various light types with color and intensity controls
-   **Interaction Nodes**: Handle user input and events
-   **Animation Nodes**: Control object animations and behaviors

### Multi-Platform Export

## Cross-Platform Implementation

Universo Platformo is being developed on multiple technology stacks:

-   **React**: This repository implements Universo Platformo on React and related technologies
-   **Godot**: A parallel implementation exists using the Godot game engine ([Universo Platformo Godot](https://github.com/teknokomo/universo-platformo-godot))
-   **PlayCanvas**: Another implementation using the PlayCanvas engine ([Universo Platformo Nebulo](https://github.com/teknokomo/universo-platformo-nebulo))
-   **Quasar**: A version built with the Quasar framework for cross-platform applications

Each implementation shares the same core concepts and goals while leveraging the strengths of its respective technology stack. The high-level abstraction layer allows projects to be exported between different implementations.
