# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Monorepo with feature apps under `packages/`.
  - Examples: `packages/publish-frt` (React front end), `packages/publish-srv` (Node/Express back end), `packages/updl` (UPDL tools).
  - Each app contains a `base/` directory for the default implementation.
- Front-end apps include `i18n/` with default locales `en/` and `ru/`.
- Context docs and planning live in `memory-bank/` (`productContext`, `techContext`, `progress`, `tasks`).
- Extends Flowise AI with Supabase multi-user features; keep upstream changes minimal and isolated.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `pnpm install`: Install workspace dependencies.
- `pnpm dev`: Start development servers (run from the target app directory when applicable). Important: due to repo size and resource usage, only the user should run this locally; agents must not run it automatically.
- `pnpm --filter <package> build`: Build a single package to validate it quickly (e.g., lint/type errors). Note: changes are fully applied across the workspace only after a full root rebuild.
- `pnpm build` (root): Full workspace rebuild; required to propagate changes (even for a single package) and ensure cross-dependency consistency.
- `pnpm start`: Run production server(s) for built apps.
- `pnpm lint`: Run ESLint across the workspace.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Prefer TypeScript where present; otherwise modern ES modules.
- Indentation: 2 spaces; avoid trailing whitespace.
- React: `PascalCase` components, `camelCase` hooks/utils, `kebab-case` folders/files.
- i18n keys use dot notation (e.g., `auth.login.button`).
- Keep changes to original Flowise code minimal and well-scoped.
- Branch names use English only (e.g., `feature/publish-workflow`, `fix/updl-parser`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests live near code in `__tests__/` or `tests/` when present.
- Write unit tests for utilities and integration tests for API routes.
- Run via `pnpm test` if configured in the target app; otherwise document manual steps in the PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, with optional scope (e.g., `feat(publish-frt): add i18n loader`).
- PRs include: clear description, linked issues, screenshots for UI, and notes on env vars or migrations.
- Small, focused PRs are preferred; include `packages/*/base` paths in the scope when relevant.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit secrets. Use `.env`/`.env.local` and keep Supabase keys private.
- If provided, copy example envs (e.g., `cp .env.example .env`) and update per app.

# Recommendations

## 1. General Principles

1.  **Review Local READMEs**: Before starting a task, always review the `README.md` in the relevant package's directory (e.g., `packages/profile-frt/base/README.md`).
2.  **Adhere to Linters**: Always follow the project's configured linters when writing code to ensure consistency and quality.
3.  **Language**: Respond to the user in Russian. However, all code comments and all information in the `memory-bank` folder must be written in English only.

## 2. Creating New Packages in `packages/<package-name>`

### 2.1. Workspace Imports

*   **DO**: When importing from another local package in the monorepo, always use the full PNPM workspace package name as defined in its `package.json` (e.g., `import { something } from '@universo/types'`).
*   **DO NOT**: Never use relative paths (`../`) to import across package boundaries.
*   **WHY**: This ensures correct module resolution via PNPM workspaces, prevents circular dependencies, and is critical for eventually extracting packages into separate repositories.

### 2.2. Frontend Packages (TSX)

*   **Technology**: New frontend packages must be written in **TypeScript (TSX)**.
*   **Build System**: Each new package must feature a dual-build system (similar to `packages/space-builder-frt`) to compile TSX into both **CommonJS** and **ES Modules**.
    *   Use two `tsconfig.json` files (`tsconfig.json` for CJS, `tsconfig.esm.json` for ESM).
    *   The compiled JavaScript output must be placed in a `dist/` directory within the package.
*   **Integration**: The package's `package.json` must correctly specify the `main` (for CJS) and `module` (for ESM) entry points, pointing to the compiled files in `dist/`. This allows new TSX components to be directly imported into the existing JSX codebase (`packages/flowise-ui`) as standard dependencies.

### 2.3. Backend Packages (TypeORM)

*   **Data Access Pattern**: Direct database calls (e.g., to the Supabase client) are forbidden. All database interaction **must** go through the **TypeORM Repository pattern**.
*   **Database Target**: Currently, all entities and migrations should be written for **PostgreSQL**, as it is the only database in use (via Supabase).
*   **Creating a New Service**: When creating a new backend service in `packages/` that requires database access, you must:
    1.  **Define Entities**: Create TypeORM entity classes for your tables inside your package's `src/database/entities/` directory.
    2.  **Register Entities**: Import and export your new entities from the central registry file: `packages/flowise-server/src/database/entities/index.ts`.
    3.  **Define & Register Migrations**:
        a. Create TypeORM migration files for any schema changes inside your package's `src/database/migrations/postgres/` directory.
        b. Create an `index.ts` file in that same directory that exports an array containing all of your package's migrations (e.g., `export const myAppMigrations = [Migration1, Migration2]`).
        c. Import your package's migration array into the central registry (`packages/flowise-server/src/database/migrations/postgres/index.ts`) and spread it into the main `postgresMigrations` array.
    4.  **Use Repositories**: In your service logic, get the shared `DataSource` via `getDataSource()` from `packages/flowise-server/src/DataSource.ts`. Use it to get a repository for your entity (e.g., `getDataSource().getRepository(YourEntity)`) to perform all database operations.
