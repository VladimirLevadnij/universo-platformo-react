# PNPM... not npm/yarn

We are using PNPM in our current project not npm/yarn.

IMPORTANT: Run PNPM commands ONLY in the root directory of the project.
Do not run commands in packages/server, packages/ui, packages/components directories.
All package management should be handled from the project root.
