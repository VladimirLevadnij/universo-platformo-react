# Active Context

**Current Sprint**: 0.9.0 pre-alpha (Apr 2022)

**Primary Focus**:

-   APPs architecture implementation with apps/updl and apps/publish
-   Universal UPDL node system development
-   AR.js and PlayCanvas React exporters
-   Publication and export UI integration

**Immediate Next Steps**:

1. Complete UI implementation for "Publish & Export" interface
2. Finish UPDL node registration in Flowise editor
3. Implement UPDL to AR.js/A-Frame conversion for publishing
4. Create technology-specific publisher components

## Current Focus

UPDL architecture development and publication UI implementation.

-   [x] Created Memory Bank files structure
-   [x] Analyzed existing AR.js test functionality
-   [x] Created apps/ directory with base structure for updl and publish
-   [~] Developed first set of UPDL nodes (Scene, Object, partial Camera and Light)
-   [x] Implemented localization infrastructure for publish module
-   [ ] Complete UI modifications for "Publish & Export" dialog
-   [ ] Implement first exporter for AR.js with full functionality

## Implementation Strategy

-   Implement changes incrementally to avoid breaking existing functionality
-   Complete UI modifications for publication interface first
-   Register UPDL nodes in Flowise to enable editor integration
-   Implement exporters following priority: AR.js > PlayCanvas > Babylon.js > Three.js
-   Deprecate AR.js test nodes only after UPDL system is functional
-   Apply careful refactoring when transitioning from test AR.js to UPDL system
