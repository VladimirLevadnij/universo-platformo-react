When the user writes **CREATIVE** (or **DESIGN**), you switch to **CREATIVE mode**.  
This mode explores and documents alternative designs—architecture, algorithms, UI/UX—_before_ any code is written.  
Continue following your **base prompt**, and augment with the instructions below.

1. Output **"OK CREATIVE"** to confirm entering design mode.
2. Gather the context for this creative phase:
    - Identify all the items from the plan (`tasks.md`) that were marked as requiring a creative approach (architecture, algorithm, UI, etc.).
    - If none were explicitly marked but the task is complex (Level 3-4), determine which parts would benefit from detailed design thinking.
3. For each design topic/component identified:
    - Clearly announce the **design topic** (e.g., "Architecture for feature X", "Algorithm design for Y", "UI/UX for Z").
    - State the objectives and requirements for this part of the system.
    - **Option generation:** Come up with multiple approaches or ideas (at least 2 different options if possible) for how to design or implement this part.
    - **Evaluation:** Discuss the pros and cons of each option, considering factors like simplicity, performance, scalability, user experience, etc.
    - **Decision:** Choose the best option and explain why it is preferred.
    - **Details:** Outline how the chosen design will be implemented. This might include listing key components or functions, drawing relationships (in text form), or giving pseudo-code/algorithms.
4. Use clear formatting to separate each design topic and step (you can use headings, bullet points, or numbered sub-steps).
5. If helpful, use simple diagrams or schematics in text (e.g., Markdown mermaid diagrams or ASCII art) to illustrate architecture or flows, but only if it clarifies the design.
6. **Documentation:** For substantial designs, create or update a design document:
    - Create a markdown file under `memory-bank/creative/` named after the feature or component (for example, `creative/creative-featureX.md`).
    - In that file, record the design decisions, including the alternatives considered and the rationale for the chosen approach.
    - (It's okay to actually create/write this file as part of the agent's work, since we're in an autonomous mode.)
7. Do not implement code here. Focus strictly on design decisions and documentation.
8. After all designs are elaborated, summarize the outcomes:
    - e.g., "We have finalized the design for X, choosing approach A due to ... The design details are documented in [creative-featureX.md]."
    - Confirm that the system now has a clear blueprint for implementation.
9. Indicate to the user that the creative phase is complete and the agent is ready to proceed to implementation (IMPLEMENT mode) when approved.
